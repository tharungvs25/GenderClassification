# Gender-Classifier: Face Detection and Gender Classification

Gender-Classifier is a simple yet effective system that combines face detection (using OpenCV's Haar Cascades) with deep learning (Hugging Face Transformers) to classify the gender of individuals in images. The project leverages pre-trained models for rapid deployment and demonstrates a clear pipeline for image analysis.
