#Gender Classification with Face Detection
This project demonstrates how to perform face detection and subsequent gender classification on images using pre-trained models from the Hugging Face transformers library and OpenCV for image processing.

Features
Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect human faces within an image.

Gender Classification: Classifies the gender (Male/Female) of detected faces using a pre-trained image classification model.

Visual Output: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces and labels them with the predicted gender.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

transformers

torch

opencv-python

Pillow

numpy
